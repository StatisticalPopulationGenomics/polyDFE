# max same: If after max same iterations, the basin-hopping algorithm does not find an improved set
#   of parameters, than the algorithm stops. Default value: 50.
# max iter: The basin-hopping algorithm is ran for a maximum of max iter iterations. Default value: 500.
# temp: The temp is the temperature used in the metropolis criterion when accepting or rejecting
#   the new values. For best results, the temperature should be comparable to the typical difference in
#   likelihood between local optima. Default value: 1.
# step: The step controls how far away from the current value the perturbated value is. This is crucial
#   for the algorithm’s performance. Ideally, it should be comparable to the typical separation between
#   local optima of the likelihood. The algorithm implemented in polyDFE will automatically adjust the
#   step, but it make take many iterations to find an optimal value. Default value: 50.
# accept rate: The target accept rate (percentage of new values that are accepted in step 3) for when
#   adjusting the step. Default value: 0.5.
# interval: Every interval iterations, the basin-hopping algorithm adjusts the step. Default value: 10.
# factor: When the step is adjusted, it is done with this factor. Default value: 0.9.
